# Vitinya - Your caffeine friend

## Vitinya frontend with React and URQL

This repository contains a simple React project to query data from AWS AppSync using URQL.

### What is URQL?

URQL is a GraphQL client that is both highly flexible and customizable - and is an appropriate choice for a wide range of projects from hobby projects to enterprise. The magic of urql is that it is simple enough to be quickly and painlessly setup on their first GraphQL project. With support for queries, mutations, a smart caching mechanism, urql comes in a small package.
